Overview of the analysis: 
	The purpose of this analysis is to determine what factors will lead to a successful funding by Alphabet soup.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:
	Data Preprocessing
		What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
			I used IS_SUCCESSFUL as the target of my models.
		What variable(s) are the features for your model?
			IS_SUCCESSFUL is never a feature for my models because it is the target. Depending on how I am testing my model, any columns not removed from the input data are considered features for my model.
		What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
			For different models, I removed a variety of combinations from EIN, NAME, STATUS, and SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, as I had believe that they were neither targets nor features.
	Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
		How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
			I started with all relu activation functions as it is faster and avoids vanishing gradients problem. I tried adding in sigmoid in my other attempts for optimization.
			I started with the usual two layers and increased to three layers in my attempts for optimization
			I started with 80 and 30 neurons as that is what was shown in the Jupyter Notebook and decreased the numbers in my attempts for optimization.
		Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
			I was not able to achieve the target model performance.
		What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
			I tried dropping more OR fewer columns.
			I tried binning different columns, creating more OR fewer bins.
			I tried adding more OR fewer neurons.
			I tried adding a third hidden layer.
			I tried different activation functions (relu and sigmoid)
			I tried reducing the number of epochs to the training regimen.
